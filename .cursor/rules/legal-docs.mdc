# Legal Documents Maintenance

When making changes to the bot that affect data collection, user features, or service functionality, you MUST update the corresponding legal documents:

## Files to Update

- **`docs/terms-of-service.md`** - Terms of Service (usage rules, user responsibilities, service description)
- **`docs/privacy-policy.md`** - Privacy Policy (data collection, storage, user rights, data retention)

## When to Update

Update the legal documents when:

1. **Data Collection Changes:**
   - Adding new data types collected
   - Changing how data is stored
   - Modifying data retention periods
   - Adding new third-party services that receive data

2. **Feature Changes:**
   - Adding new bot commands or features
   - Changing how existing features work
   - Adding new services (e.g., ticket monitoring, anniversary tracking)

3. **Infrastructure Changes:**
   - Changing database or storage providers
   - Modifying data security measures
   - Changing data processing locations

4. **User Rights Changes:**
   - Adding or modifying commands for data access/deletion
   - Changing how users can manage their data

5. **Contact Information:**
   - Updating contact methods or information

## Update Process

1. Identify which document(s) need updating (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or both)
2. Update the relevant sections with accurate information
3. Update the "Last Updated" date (handled automatically by Jekyll template)
4. Ensure cross-references between documents remain accurate
5. Verify all placeholders are filled in

## Key Sections Reference

**Terms of Service:**
- Section 2: Description of Service (bot features)
- Section 4: User Responsibilities
- Section 5: Data Collection and Privacy (summary, links to Privacy Policy)

**Privacy Policy:**
- Section 1: Information We Collect
- Section 2: How We Use Your Information
- Section 3: Data Storage and Security
- Section 3.2: Data Retention (currently: ticket violations auto-deleted after 3 months)
- Section 5: Your Rights and Choices (bot commands for data management)

## Important Notes

- Both documents are published via GitHub Pages
- Documents use Jekyll templates for automatic date updates
- Always maintain consistency between Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- Cross-reference between documents where appropriate
- Keep technical details accurate (e.g., PostgreSQL on Heroku, 3-month retention for ticket violations)
