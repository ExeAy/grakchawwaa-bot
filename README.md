### Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grakchawwaa-bot.git
cd grakchawwaa-bot
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure environment variables

- Create an `.env.dev` file with the following attributes:

  ```
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3200
    APP_NAME=grakchawaa

    DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=
    DISCORD_TOKEN=

    PGHOST=
    PGPORT=

You will need to setup your own Postgres database (for development), register your own discord bot (for manual testing) and setup you own [swgoh comlink instance](https://github.com/swgoh-utils/swgoh-comlink). From those you can fille in the values missing above.

### Database

```bash
npx ts-node infra/setupLocalDB.ts
```
